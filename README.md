# Wraith

[![shellcheck](https://github.com/ngshiheng/wraith/actions/workflows/shellcheck.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ngshiheng/wraith/actions/workflows/shellcheck.yml)

A simple utility Bash script to backup [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) publishing platform.

## Context

Getting started with Ghost is easy. You would pick between:

-   [Managed](https://ghost.org/pricing/) service
-   Self-hosted on a [VPS](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ghost) or serverless platform like [Railway](https://blog.railway.app/p/ghost)

Using managed version will most likely save you a bunch of headaches (and time) that come along with self-hosting any other sites:

-   Backups
-   Maintenance
-   Downtime recovery
-   Security, etc.

In short, youâ€™d sleep easy at night while they stay awake.

Having that said, if you want to take on the challenge of self-hosting your own Ghost site, here's a tiny script to help with your backups.

## Set up Rclone

> Reference: [rclone.org](https://rclone.org/)

Install `rclone` using `curl -s https://rclone.org/install.sh | bash`

> **Note**
> An example to configure Rclone with Google Drive:

1. Run `rclone config`
2. Name your remote `remote`
3. Follow [rlcone.org/drive](https://rclone.org/drive/)
4. If you're working on a remote machine (e.g. Digital Ocean droplet via SSH), say N for the auto config prompt and follow the instruction
5. Run `rclone lsd remote:/` to check your connection

## How to use

1. Switch to the ghost-mgr user to manage Ghost using `sudo -i -u ghost-mgr`
2. Clone this repository
3. Run [`./backup.sh`](backup.sh) from the repository directory

## Set up a Cron job

> Reference: [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/every-week)

1. Add a `crontab -e` item
2. For this example, we will back up the data every week: `0 0 * * 0 cd /$HOME/wraith/ && ./backup.sh`

## FAQ

### What to backup
